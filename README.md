# Pomodoro Timer Application

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple yet effective tool designed to enhance productivity through the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves working for focused periods (traditionally 25 minutes), followed by short breaks (typically 5 minutes).

## Features

- 25-Minute Timer: Ideal for focused work or study sessions. After completing a 25-minute session, the timer will automatically redirect you to a alarm video on YouTube.
- 5-Minute Timer: Designed for short breaks between work sessions. After the break, you're encouraged to resume your focused work session.
- Pause/Resume Functionality: Pause the timer at any moment and resume where you left off, maintaining flexibility during your workflow.
- Reset Option: Reset the timer to start a fresh session whenever needed.
